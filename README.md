# heart-disease-prediction-r
This project develops a logistic regression model in R to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical features. The primary goal is to build an interpretable and reliable classifier using a real-world medical dataset. This model is intended to aid in early risk detection and provide valuable insights for healthcare decision support.
